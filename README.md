## Project Title
**Customer Support Ticket Classification using Natural Language Processing**

## Project Abstract
Efficient customer support is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing service operations. This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify customer support tickets into predefined categories such as **technical issues, billing inquiries, and general support requests**. 

By automating the classification process, support tickets are routed to the appropriate teams, reducing response time and improving operational efficiency. The model is trained on real-world customer queries using advanced NLP algorithms, including **text preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning techniques**. 

This **intelligent ticket classification system** ensures a streamlined support workflow, leading to improved customer experiences and more effective resource allocation.
